    Write a switch statement that tests the value of the char variable response and performs the following actions:

if response is a, the message "Your request is being processed" is printed

if response is b, the message "Thank you anyway for your consideration" is printed

if response is c, the message "Sorry, no help is currently available" is printed.

for any other value of response, the message "Invalid entry, please try again!" is printed

Create Scanner object.
